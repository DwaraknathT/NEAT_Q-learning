# NEAT_Q-learning
Application of NEAT on Q-learning to solve the Pole balancing problem 
 
Genetic Algorithms and Evolutionary techniques are being considered as a scalable alternative to gradient discent powered
Deep Reninforcement Learning. This project tries to apply Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies on Q-learning based 
keras implementation of the Cartpole balancing problem using OpenAI GYM
